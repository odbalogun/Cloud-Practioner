## 1. Attach the required IAM policy to an IAM identity
    An IAM identity could be a user, user group or even a role. It basically represents any entity that can access AWS resources and be assigned policies. Here we are going to use a user group as our IAM identity
        - In the IAM management console window, select `User Groups` from the sidebar menu
        - On the Create User Group page, enter a group name and check the Billing policy checkbox in the `Attach permissions policies` pane
        - Click the create group button at the bottom of the page

## 2-4. Review your bills and usage/ Download or print bill
    - Select Billing from the Services Menu (use the search bar to easily find it)
    - Select Bills on the sidebar will load a page where you can view your monthly invoices. You can download a csv file or print the actual invoice
    - Selecting `Cost & Usage Reports` will load a page where you can see reports that break down your invoices.
